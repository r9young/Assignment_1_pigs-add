    "\n",
    "When you run git add <file> on a file that has been manually deleted, Git stages the deletion. This might seem counterintuitive because you're \"adding\" a deletion, but it helps to remember that git add is more about adding changes than adding files. It stages the current state of a file, which could also be its absence.\n",
