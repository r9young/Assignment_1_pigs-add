1. pig-add

a) What distinguishes between the usage of if [ -d/-f/-e "folder_path"]; then?

Commit operations in the pig context.




2. pig-commits

    a) How can the following issue be resolved?

    In pigs-commit.sh, on line 27:

    object_folder_name=$(ls ./.pig/objects/ | grep -E "$max") #substitute it

    A warning, SC2010, is issued, advising not to use ls | grep. Instead, it suggests employing a glob or a for loop with a condition to accept non-alphanumeric filenames.


    b) Why is it incorrect to apply a for loop and instead variables such as file1=".pig/index/" & file2=".pig/objects/$object_folder_name" have to be used? The following for loops appear to be wrong:

    for file1 in ".pig/index/"; do --- wrong
        for file2 in ".pig/objects/$object_folder_name"; do --- wrong



    c) why we cannot use the for loop but have to use file1=".pig/index/" & file2=".pig/objects/$object_folder_name"

    for file1 in ".pig/index/"; do --- wrong
        for file2 in ".pig/objects/$object_folder_name"; do --- wrong



    d) how you deal with the options in command? 



3. pig-init

    is any other better way to deal to code?


4. pig-show

    a) finding the folder's name
    folder_name=$(ls ./.pig/objects/ | grep -e "$folder_serial\s") is there a good way?
